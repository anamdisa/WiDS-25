published each year in german and english, the basf annual report shows how we as a company create value for our stakeholders and how sustainability contributes to basf’s long-term success as an integral part of our corporate purpose and our strategy.

the annual report combines the major financial and sustainability-related information necessary to comprehensively evaluate the company’s performance.

we select the report’s topics based on the principles of completeness, balance, stakeholder inclusion, sustainability context and double materiality with respect to sustainability-related information (see double materiality assessment from onward).

in the 2024 business year, basf will report pursuant to the csr directive implementation act (csr-rug) given that the corporate sustainability reporting directive (csrd) had not yet been transposed into german law.

the combined management’s report of the basf group and basf se contains a combined sustainability statement.

as a new acknowledged reporting framework in accordance with section 289d, we are voluntarily applying the first set of the european sustainability reporting standards (esrs), published as a delegated act in the official journal of the eu on december 22, 2023, for the first time in full – due to their importance as a reporting standard adopted by the european commission – and are reporting in accordance with article 8 of regulation (eu) .

the combined sustainability statement includes the (consolidated) sustainability statement as well as the nonfinancial statement (nfs) of basf se as the parent company of the basf group.

due to the importance of basf se within the basf group, specific disclosures are required when reporting key sustainability-related information.

an incorporation by reference option within the (consolidated) sustainability statement was selected in the management’s report for the nfs to be issued in the reporting year.

all disclosures on strategy, due diligence, targets, described processes and key figures contained in the statements in the combined management’s report including the (consolidated) sustainability statement apply to the basf group including basf se.

in identifying, prioritizing and validating material sustainability-related topics, we are guided by the principle of double materiality, taking into consideration financial materiality and impact materiality (see onward).

recommendations of the task force on climate-related financial disclosures (tcfd) basf supports the recommendations of the task force on climate-related financial disclosures (tcfd).

data and scope of consolidation all information and bases for calculation in this report are founded on national and international standards for financial and sustainability reporting.

more information on our sustainability parameters and collection of the underlying data can be found under general disclosures in the (consolidated) sustainability statement from onward.

the consolidation principles of sustainability reporting require application of the concept of operational control with respect to individual disclosures relating to esrs basf report 2024 combined management’s report 7 at a glance combined management’s report consolidated financial statements further information standards e1 (climate change), e2 (pollution)1 and e4 (biodiversity and ecosystems).

more information on the scope of consolidation for sustainability reporting can be found under general disclosures in the (consolidated) sustainability statement from onward.

scope 1 and 2 co 2 emissions remained the most important sustainability-related key performance indicator at group level.

this includes central tasks in the following areas: strategy; finance and controlling; legal, compliance and insurance; tax; environmental protection, health, safety and quality; human resources; communications; investor relations; corporate audit and, until the end of 2024, also the net zero accelerator unit.

in addition, the activities of the net zero accelerator unit were integrated into existing divisions and service units, effective january 1, 2025, ensuring that basf’s green transformation is aligned even more closely with market trends so that the businesses can even better react to new customer requirements.

these include: – the global economic and political environment – legal and political requirements – international trade agreements – industry standards – environmental agreements (such as the eu emissions trading system) – social aspects (such as the u.n.

basf report 2024 fundamentals of the group 13 at a glance combined management’s report consolidated financial statements further information goals for the ludwigshafen site low market growth rates in europe, a slow recovery in demand, higher gas prices than in other regions and ongoing bureaucratic hurdles have significantly burdened the european chemical industry in recent years.

in addition to short-term cost reduction measures, it addresses the expected future market and business development in europe and germany, particularly with regard to the sustainability-driven transformation, as well as a clear strategic direction for the further development of the site.

due to the numerous entry points, we can exchange raw materials in a targeted manner and, for example, use renewable and recycled raw materials in existing plants in a flexible and scalable way.

our goal is to enable ludwigshafen to operate successfully in the medium to long term as a leading, sustainable chemical site for europe with an improved competitive position on the european market.

we are systematically integrating sustainability topics into our strategy and business as well as into our assessment, steering and compensation systems.

the climate is changing, natural resources are becoming scarcer, pressure on ecosystems is increasing and our growing world population needs to be fed.

it can pave the way to greater sustainability and accelerate the transformation needed to achieve this.

our customers are also adapting their business models – to increasingly reflect a world with lower co emissions and a more circular economy.

we expect demand for chemical products with sustainability attributes to surpass supply in the medium term, which in turn will lead to greater willingness to pay for low-emission solutions.

this is also where we see the main driver of our profitable growth: our goal is for customers to be successful in their respective markets thanks to our innovations.

our products, solutions and technologies help protect the environment and climate by contributing to the more efficient use of raw materials, reducing waste, and enabling healthy and affordable food as well as climate-smart mobility.

as part of its new strategy, basf has updated its shareholder distribution policy and set medium-term financial targets for the first time (for more information on the global targets, see onward).

we remain committed to our climate protection targets and other global sustainability-related targets, including the alignment with our triples (sustainable solution steering) portfolio assessment methodology, (see ).

we have defined a new circular economy target and we have adjusted our basf report 2024 fundamentals of the group 18 at a glance combined management’s report consolidated financial statements further information supplier target and are now focusing on improving the sustainability performance of those suppliers whose audit results were inadequate.

we make sustainability part of every decision.

accelerate with the accelerate lever, basf is targeting more speed in value creation.

here, we target key functions such as sales, marketing, r&d, production, procurement and services and focus on applications with added value confirmed by fast and effective pilot projects.

going forward, we will intensify our focus on products with sustainability attributes where we see increasing customer demand.

we see sustainability as an integral part of our strategy as well as our targets, steering processes and business models.

we remain fully committed to our climate protection targets (for more information on our sustainability strategy, see onward and for more on our targets, see onward).

our ambition goes beyond the green transformation of our own production: our key customer industries are facing tremendous challenges in achieving their transformation targets.

as market developments and therefore also the speed of the green transformation vary between regions and customer industries, we are adapting our transformation approach: rather than focusing primarily on our own corporate targets, we will prioritize a market-oriented approach in the future.

furthermore, we are currently piloting new technologies in selected value chains, using alternative raw materials and have launched products with new sustainable attributes such as a reduced or net-zero product carbon footprint (low/ zero product carbon footprint; lowpcf/zeropcf).
